kubeadm upgrade plan
# it shows the current version of all the components in the cluster 
    (cluster, kubeadm, API Server, Controller Manager, Scheduler, Kube Proxy)
    and it shows the latest stable version
# After the upgrade of each component, you must upgrade manually the kubelet

*** Steps to upgrade the cluster with kubeadm

upgrade kubeadm: apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00

upgrade the cluster components: kubeadm upgrade apply v1.12.0

upgrade kubelet on the master: apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00
                               systemctl restart kubelet

upgrade kubeadm and kubelet on the worker nodes:

Drain the node: kubectl drain node01 # this is done on the master node, to drain the worker node01
upgrade kubeadm: apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.12.0-00
upgrade kubelet: apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.12.0-00
update the node configuration with the new kubelet version: kubeadm upgrade node config --kubelet-version v1.12.0
restart kubelet: systemctl restart kubelet
unschedule the node: kubectl uncordon node01 # this is done on the master node, to unschedule the worker node01
