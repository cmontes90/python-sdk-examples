**** Connecting host-a with host-b throug DNS

*** Modify the /etc/hosts on host-a 

/etc/hosts

192.168.1.11    db
192.168.1.11    www.google.com

-- host-a will refer to host-b as db or as www.google.com
-- ping db, ssh db

**** Using a DNS Server for name resolution:

-- On all the host add the dns server ip address on the /etc/resolv.conf
    nameserver      192.168.1.100
    nameserver      8.8.8.8 # to resolve any name the the first nameserver doesn't know

-- You can still have name resolution in the /etc/hosts, this will take priority over /etc/resolv.conf
-- The priority of name resolution can be change on the /etc/nsswitch.conf 
    hosts:      files dns # files refers to the /etc/hosts and dns refers to /etc/resolv.conf

**** Forward all in the DNS Server

-- to resolve any name that DNS server doesn't know you can add the following line in the DNS Server:
    Forward ALL to 8.8.8.8


**** Accessing servers by a short name rather than his fullname:

- on the dns server you have the following
    web.mycompany.com
    nfs.mycompany.com
    sql.mycompany.com
    ...
- If you want an access by a short name you can the following line in the /etc/resolv.conf
    search mycompany.com


**** Useful commands to query dns names:

    - nslookup
    - dig
