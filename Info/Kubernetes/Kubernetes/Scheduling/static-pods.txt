*** What is the path of the directory holding the static pod definition files?

- Execute: ps -aux | grep /usr/bin/kubelet and look for kubelet config file (a .yaml file)
- Then open the .yaml file and look for the StaticPodPath: 
    grep -i staticpod /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml

***** We just created a new static pod named static-greenbox. Find it and delete it

- First, let's identify the node in which the pod called static-greenbox is created: 
    kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
- Next, SSH to node01 and identify the path configured for static pods in this node
    ps -aux | grep /usr/bin/kubelet
- Then open the .yaml file and look for the StaticPodPath: 
    grep -i staticpod /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
