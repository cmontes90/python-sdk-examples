## Tains are apply to nodes, while Tolerations are apply to pods

# TAINT

kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:taint-efect
# The taint-effect could be any of the following three options:
    NoSchedule ----------> it will not schedule the pod on the tainted node
    PreferNoSchedule ---->  it will TRY not to schedule the pod on the tainted node
    NoExecute -----------> it will delete any pod that was on the node before the tainted

kubectl taint nodes node01 app=blue:NoSchedule

kubectl taint nodes controlplane node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule-
