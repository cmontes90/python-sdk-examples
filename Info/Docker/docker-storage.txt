docker volume create data_volume
# it creates a persistent volume called data_volume (folder) on the host

docker run -v data_volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql
# it maps the data from the mysql database which is located in the directory /var/lib/mysql 
# to the directory data_volume which is the volume that was created before

docker run -v data_volume2:/var/lib/mysql mysql
# the data_volume2 directory will be automatically created on the host and be mount it on the container

# ALL THE FILES FROM THE CONTAINERS, INCLUDING THE VOLUMES, CAN BE CHECKED ON THE HOST IN THE FOLDER /var/lib/docker

# Bind mounts

docker run -v /data/mysql:/var/lib/mysql mysql
# this is a BIND mount not a VOLUME mount, which it means that the folder /data/mysql 
# is not on the default location for the container /var/lib/docker

docker run --mount type=bind, source=/data/mysql,target=/var/lib/mysql mysql
# New way to mount a volume on the container
