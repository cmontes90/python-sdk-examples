# The following AWS CLI command creates a new member account:

aws organizations create-account --email <newAccEmail> --account-name "<newAccName>" /
--role-name <roleName>

# This CLI command returns a request_id that uniquely identifies the request, 
a value that is required for in Step 3.

# The following CLI command, with the request_id returned in the previous step as an input parameter, 
# verifies that the account was created:

aws organizations describe-create-account-status --create-account-request-id <request_id>

# The command returns the state of your account creation request 
# and can have three different values: IN_PROGRESS, SUCCEEDED, and FAILED.

# The following CLI command assumes a role from the Master account

aws sts assume-role --role-arn <role-arn> --role-session-name <"role-session-name">

# After you assume the role, build the new accountâ€™s networking, IAM, 
and governance resources as explained in this section.

# The following CLI command moves an account into an OU.

aws organizations move-account --account-id <account_id> /
--source-parent-id <source_parent_id> --destination-parent-id <destination_parent_id>
